In this project, I built an image classification system based on a neural network to recognize four different weather conditions: Cloudy, Rain, Shine, and Sunrise. The project involved three main stages.

* Building a Neural Network (CNN) without Transfer Learning:
I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Dropout layers to prevent overfitting. Various architectures were tested to achieve the highest accuracy.

* Applying Data Augmentation:
Augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustment were added to enrich the dataset and improve model performance. The impact of augmentation on accuracy was analyzed.

* Adding Transfer Learning:
A pre-trained VGG model was adapted and fine-tuned for classifying the four weather categories. The performance of the Transfer Learning approach was compared to the original CNN.



 Results:
 
A comparative analysis of accuracies was conducted at each stage, highlighting the effect of each enhancement on the overall system performance.
